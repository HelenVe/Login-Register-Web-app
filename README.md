# Login-Register-Web-app
This is a simple web app that uses Java Servlets and Eclipse, to implement login and register functions.
I used HTML5/CSS for the web pages.
It is also connected to a MySQL Database. It contains tables for the username, password, name, surname, address of the user.
The user can register, and login. There are html pages for sucessfull and unsucessful login.
